## Problem Statement
To build a simple DIY Home Automation System using a NODEMCU to monitor energy usage, security system, etc.

## Description
In order to contol the ESP8266, we use a mobile application called Blynk. The Blynk app is easy to use and is packed with many features that allows one to control from anywhere in the world. Once the Blynk app is downloaded and configured, an Auth_Token is received which is to be included in the Arduino code. For this feature to be enabled in the Arduino, [Blynk library](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library) must be integrated with the Arduino IDE (which is the IDE for NODEMCU as well).
