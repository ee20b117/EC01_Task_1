## Problem Statement
A TinyML approach to prevent Electric grid overload.

## Description
There are various challenges when it comes to applying AI to smart Electric Grids like Insufficient data accumulation, Reliability, Infrastructure, Lack of power insdustry-specific algorithms, etc. In this project, we predict the grid stability using Neuton TinyML and an integrated IoT platform, Particle IoT, an approach where we combine the knowledge of AI and IoT. 
### Hardware components
Particle Argon
### Software requirements
Neuton TinyML Neuton
Particle Build Web IDE
