This repositary contains all the attempts that has been made so far regarding the [Task-1](https://github.com/ee20b117/EC01_Task_1/blob/sarav/Task-1/Mini-Task%201/EC01_Task_1.pdf).
The problem statements for the minitasks and the project task are:

## Mini-Task 1
    1. Create a GitHub account using your smail
    2. Learn Git and Git bash by following any Youtube tutorial
    3. Clone your project repository and create a branch with your name.
    4. Create a Repository named ”Task-1” using Command Line (CL) in your
    branch. Create a folder with Mini-Task 1. Add this PDF into the folder
    using the Command Line.
    5. Add all the upcoming tasks in the same repository in a different folder.
    6. Fork this repository.
    Refer Clone vs Fork to learn more
    
## Mini-Task 2
    Select 7 distinct projects based on the below mentioned criteria and understand them thoroughly (If asked anything about it, you must be able to explain
    it clearly).
    Some helpful websites: Instructables, Hackster.io, Hackaday, randomnerdtutorials, etc.
    • They should strictly be from different domains
    • The project should be of medium-hard difficulty to replicate.
    • At Least 4 projects out of 7 should not include Arduino (Electronics is
    more than just building things around Arduino).
    Now, document all the 7 projects on GitHub. Create a folder named ”Mini-Task 2”. Add a brief description of all the 7 Projects and your personal notes,
    comments or any improvements you can think of. Note:
    • For At Least 3 Projects, Add Images along with the description.
    • For At Least 2 Projects, Add GIFs along with the description.
    
## Mini-Task 3
    Choose at least 2 projects from the previous 7 project list and suggest better
    approaches to solve the same problem and argue why your idea is more feasible/easy to implement /cost-effective /less power consuming, etc.
    Submission format: Draft it the same way or in a better way than what
    has been done above. Create a folder again for this task.

## Mini-Task 4
    Choose any one of the same 2 projects that you chose in Mini-Task 2 and write
    a Debugging tutorial for it. Explain it in detail and in a recursive fashion.
    Submission format: Document the explanation in a new file under the same
    repository.
    
## Project Task
    Visit the repository of your project and open your branch (Additional Task:
    Learn about branching in GitHub). Append a file into your branch and start
    documenting on your project. Follow the steps from Mini-Task 2 and 3. Use
    your Project Member app (pipeline question) for your reference.
